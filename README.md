Decision Trees and Random Forests 
This project demonstrates the use of tree-based models for classification using the Iris dataset. A Decision Tree Classifier is trained and visualized to understand how the model splits features. Overfitting is analyzed by controlling tree depth. A Random Forest model is then trained for comparison, showing improved accuracy. Feature importances are interpreted, and model performance is evaluated using cross-validation.
